    <p class="description"> The song that was number one on my birthday (July 28th, 1999) was Will Smith - "Wild Wild West" ft. Dru Hill & Kool Mo Dee.<br>
        <br>
        "Wild Wild West" is a song by American rapper and actor Will Smith from the 1999 film of the same name, in which he also starred. The song plays during the film's closing credits. The single includes parts of the chorus from Kool Moe Dee's song of the same name, and samples Stevie Wonder's 1976 hit song "I Wish". Kool Moe Dee re-performed the chorus for the song, and additional guest vocals are provided by Dru Hill. The album version of the song is introduced by a brief spoken-word interlude where Smith asks his infant son Jaden what song he should play next, interpreting Jaden's repeated non-verbal response as "Wild Wild West".<br>

       <br> "Wild Wild West" was released on May 11, 1999, as a single from the film's soundtrack and as the lead single from Smith's second studio album, Willennium (1999). The song became a number-one hit on the US Billboard Hot 100, and its extended music video, directed by Paul Hunter, features Wonder and several other celebrities as guest stars. The song was nominated for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000. </p>
